# RailsBridge
## Security
- CSRF
  - Faking POST requests are from one website to another
  - Imagine going to a website that has a button that sends a post request to a one-click buy to a different site
  - Two ways to prevent this:
    - Check refer header
    - Make sure your form has a secret key; each post request should have a matching secret key, otherwise the post request will not be processed
    - When a form is show, a site should give the user a token that will be stored in the cookies. Each form post will have a CSRF token. The cookie stored is an encrypted version of that token that is encrypted with the site’s secret key
- Auth token
  - A very long, random string that ties a user to the backend
  - When a user logs in with their username and password and that login credentials is verified through hashing, the user receives an unique auth token that is stored in the cookies
  - Auth tokens can be revoked (log out of all session)
  - OAuth - easier for users, more secure b/c one can revoke access AND the user doesn’t have to give data to a random service
  - FB Login button => fb.login?partner=mysite.com
After logging in and being sent back the partner, FB also sends an access token to the partner site
  - Refresh token - access tokens with a time limit; after the time limit, it automatically gets revoked
- Database access controls
  - Admins has access to add, drop, etc. tables
  - You can add rate limiters
- XSS (cross-site scripting)
  - Form of script injection
  - Script injection: `<script>alert();</script>`
  - Two domains interacting together
  - Sanitize users’ inputs (escaping special characters)
  - SQL injections (user enters SQL to drop table users, for example) - should sanitize and escape users inputs to prevent running this SQL command
- Encryption
  - Hashing - one way data
  - Encryption  two way
  - Symmetric (one key) & asymmetric (two-keys)
  - Scrambles the data
  - What data do we encrypt?
    - PCI
    - SSN
    - Sensitive data that is stored in the data
    - The encryption key (key management service, heroku config file, etc.) and the encrypted data (in the database) are stored separated
    - Information (data packets) sent to and from servers via HTTPS
  - Firewalls: information sent will get dropped if it does not go through a specific IP & port. Firewalls are essentially a set of rules. WIthin a LAN, it’s not necessary to encrypt within the LAN.
- GDPR: a set of regulations that companies must follow if they have EU customers
  - Data must be stored within EU
  - Users can request to have their data deleted.
- Obfuscation:
  - “Security through obscurity”
  - Making input (like passwords) hidden as the user types it
  - Creating random endpoint (abcde123mydatabase.com)
  - Sometimes necessary. DRM - digital rights management (ex. locking down music to a user’s itunes)
  - Most of the time, if you’re using security through obscurity, you’re doing security wrong

## Build a Rails app and different ways to persist data, the tradeoffs between those options
- How do we persist data in an app?
  - Database
  - Localstorage (client-side, stored by browser)
    - Client-side database accessible by a js script tag localStorage.get(“”)
    - Can only be queried by the js script
  - Cookies (client-side, stored by browser)
    - Stored on the client-side but is sent with - every request sent to the server
    - Constraints: 4kb per domain
    - Minimize amount of data; adds overhead to each request
  - URL/page (client-side)
    - The most state-less
    - Nothing is stored on the client/server sides
- When would you want to use one over the other?
  - Most cases - DB.
  - Auth tokens, very minimal amounts of data - cookies
    - Personalization without login (language - settings, geolocation, etc.) or storage of lots of information on the client-side - localStorage
  - Temporary storage of data (before it gets stored to the DB) or sharable data - URL
Params: query string, body, form encoding, controller, headers, etc.

## High level overview of production deployment
- AWS, Heroku - AWS has products that do the same functions as Heroku
- Circle CI, Jenkins - runs build & tests, if all green (or blue), push to deployment
- Canary - tests small bits of traffic on production
- Monitoring - New Relic, Data Dog
